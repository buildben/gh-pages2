[BuildBen](https://buildben.io/) is a **Multi-Cloud CI/CD booster** that reduces pipeline run time from 60 to 5 minutes with one touch by automatically parallelizing existing build & testing tools across multiple Docker (or VM) containers.
The technology is automatic and seamless, requires no changes to code or tools, and works with all CI/CDs and instruments such as `Maven, NodeJS, Selenium, SonarQube, Python` and etc. Auto-scaling on `K8S / OpenShift / AWS EKS` as well as other cloud environments makes it efficient and easy to use. BuildBen supports `Windows, macOS, Linux` and can run bare-metal.

This projects purpose is to provide the detailed user manuals for [BuildBen](https://buildben.io/) platform. It's in the continues creation stage and currently covers the trial platform version deployment on `AWS EKS`.
